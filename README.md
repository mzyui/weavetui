`weavetui` is the flagship application and primary demonstration of the `weavetui` Text User Interface (TUI) framework. It showcases how to build sophisticated and interactive terminal applications by leveraging the modular design principles provided by `weavetui_core` and the development efficiency offered by `weavetui_derive`.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Comprehensive Component Integration:** Demonstrates the seamless integration of various UI components (e.g., `Header`, `Sidebar`, `Content`, `Button`, `Footer`) into a cohesive application structure.
*   **Real-world Application Example:** Provides a practical example of a TUI application, illustrating best practices for component composition, state management, and event handling within the `weavetui` ecosystem.
*   **Modular and Extensible:** Built upon the `weavetui_core` and `weavetui_derive` crates, ensuring a highly modular, maintainable, and extensible codebase.
*   **Interactive User Experience:** Designed to offer a responsive and engaging user experience directly within the terminal environment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To get `weavetui` up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weavetui.git # Replace with actual repository URL
    cd weavetui
    ```

2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

    This will launch the `weavetui` application in your terminal.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is organized as a Rust workspace, encompassing the following crates:

*   `weavetui/` (root): The main application crate, responsible for orchestrating the UI and application logic.
*   `weavetui_core/`: A foundational library defining core TUI traits, components, and utilities.
*   `weavetui_derive/`: A procedural macro crate that provides the `#[component]` attribute for automatic trait implementation.
